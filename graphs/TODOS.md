Challenges

1. ~~Download thinkcomplex. com/ GraphCode. py , which contains the code in this chapter. Run it as a script and make sure the test code in main does what you expect.~~ 

2. ~~Make a copy of GraphCode.py called Graph.py. Add the following methods to Graph, adding test code as you go.~~

3. ~~Write a method named get_edge that takes two vertices and returns the edge between them if it exists and None otherwise. Hint: use a try statement.~~

4. ~~Write a method named remove_edge that takes an edge and removes all references to it from the graph.~~

5. ~~Write a method named vertices that returns a list of the vertices in a graph.~~

6. ~~Write a method named edges that returns a list of edges in a graph. Note that in our representation of an undirected graph there are two references to each edge.~~

7. ~~Write a method named out_vertices that takes a Vertex and returns a list of the adjacent vertices (the ones connected to the given node by an edge).~~

8. ~~Write a method named out_edges that takes a Vertex and returns a list of edges connected to the given Vertex.~~

9. ~~Write a method named add_all_edges that starts with an edgeless Graph and makes a complete graph by adding edges between all pairs of vertices.~~
